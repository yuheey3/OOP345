1.the reason for specializing the sum() member function.
The original sum is return value() + val or val in my code.
By specializing the sum() member function, I could control display value.
		
2.the reason for specializing the initial value for a summation.
We use two different files. Two file's argument is could be different,integer or a string. 
By specializing summation, we can make what the safe empty value is. 

3.the reason for defining the class variable outside the class definition.
Becuase it is a one Definition Rule. Each static object must be defined once.
Class definitions usally go in header files, included in multiple sources,
If the static object's declaration in the header were a definition, 
there are multiple definition, also each unit that includes 
the header, which would break the rule. So instead,we must provide exactly one definition
outsite the class definition.

4.In this workshop,I've learnd how to use template generally and how to specialize a member function of a class template.
The hardest part was specializing member function.
