## Subject Description
This subject expands the student's skill-set in object-oriented programming and introduces the student to threaded programming.  
The student learns to model relationships between classes using containers, inheritance hierarchies and polymorphism in
the C++ programming language and to write C++ programs that execute on multiple threads.
  
  
 ### Learning Outcomes:
1.Design collections of model objects using sequential containers and multi-dimensional arrays to solve a systems or business problem
2.Create function objects and closures to customize a programming solution for a particular application
3.Model generalization and specialization using inheritance hierarchies to minimize the duplication of code
4.Model polymorphic behavior using interfaces, virtual functions and templates (generics) to amplify the reusability of code
5.Implement design components using algorithms of the standard template library to utilize existing technologies
6.Create program components of quadratic complexity to solve non-linear problems
7.Design program components using raw pointers and pointer arithmetic to access data in program memory
8.Design multi-tasked solutions using threading libraries to improve the performance of a program
9.Design file stream objects to backup text and binary data for future restoration
