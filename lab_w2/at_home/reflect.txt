Q1: the reason for the significant time difference between the copy and move operations

 moving allows the source to be left in a invalid state, so you can steal 
it's resources. If a object holds a pointer to a large block of allocated memory, 
a move can simply steal the pointer while a copy must allocate its own memory and copy the whole memory block.
On the other hand, Copying an object means you have to copy it's contents in memory.

In this workshop, I have learned how the differences between copy and move operations.
Also It's my first time to use 'chrono' library. During this workshop, I had difficulty of making 
duration function. I had to declear appropriate prototype and then calculate. (endT - startT)
this one was difficult to think of it, but it was in the document that I didn't know that for a while.

Quiz 2 Reflection
What does do the pure virtual function?
-I answerd only 2 things to make a pure virual function.
A pure virtual function is a virtual function for which we don’t have implementation, 
we can only declare it. A pure virtual function is declared by assigning 0 in declaration.
